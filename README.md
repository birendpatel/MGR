# MGR

This repository contains prototypes of some accounting software that I develop for a client. 

We use the QT Python binding PySide2 to quickly draft up new ideas for testing and debugging. Since the client doesn't care for additional licensing or source code privacy, the QT GPL license allows me to keep these prototypes public.
